# Snake

A simple Snake game built with React Native using the React Native Game Engine (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-game-engine).
There are settings to: increase/decrease difficulty (speed of the snake); change the colour of the snake; allow the snake to 
teleport to the other side of the grid when it hits a boundary (instead of ending the game).
